# Enel MongoDB scenario
In this scenario you will learn how to use
`MongoDB`.

Here we run the code in a docker container. The goals
of this scenario are:
* learn how to install a `MongoDB` local instance and 
how to use `db` and `collection`;
* insert data in a collection and retrieve data
with simple queries;
* manage complex databases with more than one collection;
* how to use `pymongo`.
