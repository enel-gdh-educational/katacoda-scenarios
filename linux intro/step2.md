#### A) List the contents of the current directory

Hint: Use the command **ls**

Try out few arguments of the **ls** command:
- Use **-F** to append an indicator of the file type
- Use **-l** to output detailed information on the directory
- Use **-S** to sort the results by name
- Use **-t** to sort the results by modification
- Use **-R** to display a recursive listing

Notice that you can combine two or more argument.

```
ls -lR
```{{execute}}

#### B) List the contents of the directory ./datasets, sorted by name.

Hint: This task can be solved passing the required directory as argument to the command **ls**

#### C) Recursively list the contents of the directory ./neural_network, sorted by last modification.

Hint: Combine the arguments **-R** and **-t** on the command **ls**, specifying the required directory
