This definitely isn't the Ritz, and if you're looking for a luxury get-away, you're barking up the wrong tree. However, if you're like we were: first time visitors on a budget with humble taste, then this place is perfect. The location is a tiny bit removed from the touristy Beachwalk shopping area, but not so far as to preclude you from limbering up for a spirited walk over there. And by the marina, you're actually quite close to the Ala Moana mall. So, the location is good. The place itself is a modest studio setup, but perfectly adequate with a good sized bed for a couple, enough space for your luggage, and a kitchenette and bathroom that though tight, is perfectly fine. There's also cable and internet if you're looking for homey creature comforts. It was also fantastic to have a free parking space included, an air conditioning wall unit, and the panoramic window view was pretty cool, though you only really get a peak of the beach. Also, David was very good about staying in contact with us the day we arrived to get acclimated, and we did not have further occasion to require his services the rest of our stay, so our contact was minimal, but satisfactory ... no problem there. The minor quibbles we had were pretty thin walls, so we would often hear the murmur of the neighbors' TVs. Also, there seemed to be two elevators working the entire building, so they could take quite a while to pop up. Again though, if you're like us, your #1 priorities are spend a minimal amount of time in your room, get out to experience Hawaii, come back to a sanitary place to sleep at night, all while staying within a reasonable budget. This place fit the bill, and we would recommend it to anyone with the same priorities."}, {"_id": "8363944", "date": {"$date": 1382932800000}, "listing_id": "1001265", "reviewer_id": "7096845", "reviewer_name": "Jean", "comments": "Fantastic location!

The condo is in a great location if you want to be in or near Waikiki and Ala Moana. It's a small studio, and not luxurious, but great if you want a functional, reasonably comfortable and very affordable base for exploring Oahu. The parking space is wonderful if you rent a car, as otherwise you're looking at an additional $15-$20 a day. The building is right on Ala Moana Blvd so it's noisy if you keep the windows open, but that's also true of many high-price Waikiki hotel rooms. Air conditioning is a bit noisy; I slept with earplugs but my boyfriend didn't need them (I'm a light sleeper and use them at home). The condo has a full size fridge, small cooktop, microwave, coffee maker, coffee press, beach chairs, some knackered beach mats, towels, pots, plates, etc.. Wifi is a plus. The bathroom appears quite recently updated, and though small is nice - great shower. \r\n\r\nCons: There's no lanai and the view is very partial, but to us those were small things. Elevators were sometimes very slow and occasionally out of commission, which was a hassle and a bit concerning.\r\n\r\nWe never actually met David. All was handled by text and email. He instructed us to get someone to let us in to the building, which seemed a bit dodgy, but in the end it was no problem, and he said to call if there was any issue. Condo door was unlocked and keys were on the table.\r\n\r\nI would consider staying here again if I plan to stay in the Waikiki vicinity. \r\n\r\n"}, {"_id": "11063672", "date": {"$date": 1395115200000}, "listing_id": "1001265", "reviewer_id": "12932701", "reviewer_name": "Tami", "comments": "If you are looking for a home base with the basics to lay your head at night and have breakfast in and then head out for the day this fits the bill. It's close to Waikiki and the downtown area but not in the thick of things so if you're looking to avoid the 24/7 hustle and bustle then this might work for you. There is a basic kitchenette and eating area. Accessories for enjoying the sand and surf are available for use, pool, and hot tub as well, and secure parking which is a plus.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for expansive ocean views, a room to hang out and relax in with up to date decor, and where you can easily meet and get to know people staying in the complex then this wouldn't be for you.

Here are my reasons:\r\nFirst - she as a person made me feel super welcome. I requested her a really early check in and she agreed (which was helpful because I took a red eye from Seattle). She also allowed me to keep my bags after my check out time so I could pick it up before my flight.\r\nSecond - her apartment location is SUPER convenient. Right next to the #1 and pretty close to B and C lines. NYC is all about location is this fits perfectly.\r\nThird - her apartment gives the feel of a typical NYC apartment. It is tiny but has everything you need. Two beds, a great shower, clean towels, and a kitchen (which I didn't use). Safe building with elevator. \r\n\r\nI would totally stay here again.

The fact that there was a desk in the house made my stay all the more comfortable - I had a proper place to sit down at my computer.\r\n\r\nIt's clear that Zeynep has put a lot of care into making her flat a home - it's an awesome flat! \r\n\r\nZeynep lives a five min walk to the sea, with a great park along the water front. There are plenty of hip cafes and coffee shops in the neighborhood (Moda), all a short walk from the flat. And it's only a 15 mins walk to the Kadikoy ferry, which offers easy access to the rest of Istanbul."}]}, {"_id": "10051164", "listing_url": "https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10051164", "name": "Catete's Colonial Big Hause Room B", "summary": "Old floor, intirely reformed, destined to receive people in a very harmonious and welcoming place.

Even though we booked our room through Airbnb, we were welcome to all the amenities the hotel had to offer.  We were pleased from our arrival at the hotel, where the exterior was as pretty as the interior and greeted by Robert whose very pleasant demeanor was refreshing.  Each of the staff at the hotel were very professional and accommodating but Robert stood out from the rest.  I was unfortunate enough to have left my phone at a nearby shop after returning via the hotel shuttle, when notifying the front desk to see if I had left my phone in the back seat, Robert quickly responded with his assistance in searching for the item, then driving us immediately to the last location while he assured us he would be outside waiting so we would not have to walk back. I did in fact find my phone at that location (thanks to a good Samaritan) and Robert refused to take compensation for his kindness.  The only thing I would do differently on our next stay is to spend the extra for the room with the patio, as the view from the hotel is quite nice and the breezes up there were wonderful.  We not only will be back to visit the lovely hotel but will gladly recommend it to all who might be vising the Greenpoint area.

It is so close that I could go there on foot, and that is why I chose it. However, the location itself appeared to be great: the neighborhood around was magnificent, a very vibrant area, with extremely cheap and nice restaurants, street food vendors, shops etc everywhere. And actually, not touristic at all, you are going to see how local people live around there. Especially Mong Kok, which is just a little bit south, I really enjoyed walking around in the evenings. There are plenty of bus stops around, and the subway is at most 5 minutes away.\n\nThe place was also very nice. It was nice to see how common houses there look like and live there. Do not expect high luxuries or something, it is just a normal house. For me, it was a very nice place and adequately clean. There is also kitchen but I did not use it; there is tons of great and cheap food around, so there was no reason to spend time cooking (but Vicky one cooked and shared)! In general, I did not experience any negative issue regarding the facilities of the house.\n\nVicky provides with a sim card with unlimited internet, so it is even better than just having wifi in the house, as you can have internet in your smartphone or laptop everywhere you go. This helped navigating around the city a lot.\n\nVicky and her flatmate, J., were really nice and friendly. Initially, Vicky gave exact and clear instructions on how to get there. Both gave quite many suggestions on what to do in the city, and I even spent time with them. Both seem very interested in interacting with the guests, as long as they have time, of course. \n\nOverall, I am really enjoyed my stay there. I enjoyed being in that location and walking around. Everything concerning the house was working fine, making my stay in Hong Kong comfortable. Also I am very happy to have met Vicky and J., and enjoyed our interactions. I would certainly recommend."}, {"_id": "181577731", "date": {"$date": 1502596800000}, "listing_id": "10084023", "reviewer_id": "31316205", "reviewer_name": "Ay\u00e7a", "comments": "Vicky was very helpful and provided any assistance I needed.

The apartment is very quiet for the area. Although I never met Yi in person she was always accessible to communicate. The room was very sparse but functional wifi was good.\n\nThe place has 3 bedrooms, a common living room with a table, a Chinese style kitchen and a very tiny showering area with hot water which is typical of Hong Kong apartments. There is a functional  TV. The price  is fantastic, cannot be matched.\n\nNow the not so good. The place is the most dirty place I have ever stayed at in HK, and at one point I lived for many years in HK. Yi mentioned the cleaning fee was for the bedrooms only and also no towel is included, which I believe she listed but I did not notice.  The place is good for backpackers and undergraduates. The entire week I was there 4 to 5 men and women stayed there and I can state the bathroom was never cleaned. The kitchen looks like a tornado hit it, and some of the grime is that thick amber tacky stuff from years of grease buildup. The living room is a thick dusty mess, the sheet covering the couch reeks. I had no idea someone, an airline stewardess who I never saw, had her personal things there and in fact the apartment was her home.  I borrowed a mirror left out on the table, and ate some crackers that I mistakenly thought were left by previous guests and it caused huge problems but I immediately returned the mirror and replaced the crackers.\n\nAll in all a mixed experience. I am sure others saw what I saw, but did not mention the messy aspect in their reviews. I am not being picky, but I wish I had know before I booked what I would actually encounter.\n\n Still it is a good deal, best walked into with your eyes wide open and a high tolerance for filthy common areas."}, {"_id": "400087952", "date": {"$date": 1547182800000}, "listing_id": "10084023", "reviewer_id": "233481626", "reviewer_name": "Li", "comments": "\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u65b9\u4fbf,\u623f\u4e1c\u8010\u5fc3,\u4eba\u7f8e\u5fc3\u5584!"}, {"_id": "402007119", "date": {"$date": 1547701200000}, "listing_id": "10084023", "reviewer_id": "38063545", "reviewer_name": "Andy", "comments": "."}, {"_id": "402572546", "date": {"$date": 1547874000000}, "listing_id": "10084023", "reviewer_id": "234227205", "reviewer_name": "Jason", "comments": "\u5f88\u68d2\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u9ad4\u9a57"}, {"_id": "403896707", "date": {"$date": 1548133200000}, "listing_id": "10084023", "reviewer_id": "6469979", "reviewer_name": "William", "comments": "this is a cool little place - has a lounge - and kitchen! would definitely go back here for sure!"}, {"_id": "406308919", "date": {"$date": 1548738000000}, "listing_id": "10084023", "reviewer_id": "6259521", "reviewer_name": "Rhianwen", "comments": "This is a good, affordable place to stay while exploring Hong Kong for a few days, especially if you're going to be out and about a lot.

Though this area in Sham Shui Po is not posh, its down to earth vibes makes this place very real.\u00a0"}, {"_id": "417991701", "date": {"$date": 1551416400000}, "listing_id": "10084023", "reviewer_id": "244096303", "reviewer_name": "\u96ef", "comments": "\u771f\u7684\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6027\u4ef7\u6bd4\u8d85\u9ad8\u7684\u4f53\u9a8c,\u975e\u5e38\u9002\u5408\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u5355\u72ec\u5c45\u4f4f\uff61\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5f88\u68d2,\u5f88\u65b9\u4fbf\u5c31\u5728\u8343\u6e7e\u7ebf\u4e0a\u79bb\u5e02\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5f88\u8fd1\uff61Yi\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u9762\u4e4b\u7f18,\u4e0d\u8fc7\u771f\u7684\u662f\u4e2a\u5f88\u6f02\u4eae\u5f88nice\u5973\u5b69,\u623f\u95f4\u5f88\u5c0f\u4e0d\u591f\u8fd8\u4e0d\u9519\u5566~"}]}, {"_id": "10091713", "listing_url": "https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10091713", "name": "Surry Hills Studio - Your Perfect Base in Sydney", "summary": "This spacious, light filled studio has everything you need to enjoy Sydney and is the perfect base for exploring.

I let ben know and he didn't reply. I chased 2 days later and he agreed to come and take a look - afterwards the issue was much worse and the entire floor was covered in water, the shower then also wouldn't turn off.

On arrival, the apartment was quite grubby and full of host's personal possessions with only 2 drawers left for the two of us over a fortnight. The fridge had half empty jars, food stains were all over the cabinet doors, and the place was dusty.\nWe had a disaster in that we accidentally left the keys in the apartment (that locks behind you!). We were unable to contact Ben for over 2 days as he had left the country without informing us - ending with us out on the street for hours, having to stay in a hostel overnight and eventually paying for a locksmith as we desperately needed our belongings. Ben was not even remotely apologetic once he finally got in contact with us. \nOnce we asked him if it was possible for him to reimburse for the locksmith and other costs, he replied aggressively with snarky and unnecessarily nasty comments about our stay - saying we had left wet towels on the floor when actually we had left one wet towel in the laundry basket that we had used to clean the water from the leaking toilet that was a great inconvenience throughout our stay and has been a complaint from another guest. Also said we raked through his personal belongings which were against his 'rules', when actually we only used a couple of towels from a drawer since he only left us one bath towel for two people for a fortnight. Ben has also attempted to charge us 100AUD regarding a small stain on the bed sheet, which is a completely ridiculous price especially considering the fee that we paid for cleaning.\nFurthermore, we asked where he would like his new keys to be left so he could get back in his apartment - to which eventually he said to 'leave them on the kitchen table'. This obviously doesn't make any sense and he only replied a few hours before our departure so we replied we would leave one of the keys in an envelope in his letterbox under his other mail. Only after we requested reimbursement days after we had left, he replied in a hostile manner that he had to pay for his own locksmith as we didn't leave him his key(?). \nOverall a dreadful experience that we wouldn't like anyone else to go through, as leaving the keys in an apartment when the door locks behind your back could essentially happen to anyone. This could have been handled far more efficiently & pleasantly if the host had actually been a decent person so BEWARE."}, {"_id": "238803427", "date": {"$date": 1519707600000}, "listing_id": "10091713", "reviewer_id": "13988353", "reviewer_name": "Selina", "comments": "We travelled with a 4 month old baby.

I was impressed at the Desire\u00e9's thoughtfulness in accommodating her guests needs. Such things as a kind welcome note. Petite chocolates, mini fresh milk packs in the fridge, expresso machine and every conceivable toiletry item one could need inside a bathroom cabinet. Discreetly rolled up extension cords so you never have to look for one to reach the wall socket to charge your digital devices. The bed was comfortable, where sprigs of fragrant lavender greeted us laid upon freshly rolled up towels. We loved our stay and highly recommend Desire\u00e9 as a host. She communicated well, was always polite and prompt with messaging all required information upon booking. There's no doubt why Desire\u00e9 has been voted as a super host.

She had everything I needed in the room including clean towels, cold water, a fan, books, and anything else I might need. The best part about her apartment was Mason the pup, he's VERY sweet! I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others. Thank you Cheer!

Contact via email prior to arrival was easy and Lane always responded quickly. During our stay we didn't have much Interaktion with Lane and Annette though,  since we were gone exploring the city most of the time. The room was fine and just like depicted, but, as mentioned in previous comments, quite hot. The subway was only a short walk away, however, if there were constructions or delays, it sometimes took us over an hour to get into Manhatten - so just be aware of that. If you are planning to cook while in New York, I wouldn't necessarily recommend their place as the kitchen was rather poorly equipped and the cupboards above the stove were pretty greasy. Altogether: if you are just staying for a couple of nights and don't expect to be right at the edge of Manhatten, it's a good place to stay at.

Their spot is in Jamaica, Queens and about an 8-10 min walk to the F and E trains at the Kew Gardens stop so it's super easy to get to and from the city and JFK. If you love NY pizza as much as I do, there's a spot not far from the trains on Queens Blvd right next to the McDonlads and a cafe as well as other eateries and shops. However, if you'd prefer to cook, they do have a kitchen, which I did not take advantage of. Again, I was out and about pretty much the whole time, but Lane's place is an excellent place if you need a clean bed and shower. Oh, and if I'm not mistaken I saw a Keurig, which I also did not take advantage of, but if you need some caffeine to start your day, then boom!"}, {"_id": "218267130", "date": {"$date": 1512968400000}, "listing_id": "10140368", "reviewer_id": "103900814", "reviewer_name": "Javeria", "comments": "Very pleasant lady and very clean space"}, {"_id": "218579136", "date": {"$date": 1513141200000}, "listing_id": "10140368", "reviewer_id": "124988427", "reviewer_name": "Andreea", "comments": "A warm, inviting home.

I met nice people who gave me good advices to get around Sydney. David, the host, is very responsible and responded on the post to my emails while I was there. Being large, the house is very quiet and no one really bother anyone else. A cleaner shows up everyday, they were two ladies when I was there. They do an amazing job keeping the place spotless, and they are also very sweet. Now, Coggee is an amazing place. The house is up the street from the beach- there is also a large green park next to the beach. It's really nice. I went swimming at the ladies bath (sometype of sea water swimming pool on the beach) the first morning despite being Winter: amazing! I find that the picture showing Coggee beach do not make justice. It is so much more beautiful. I can't wait to go back there.

There's a 2persons bed, a build-in closet, another closet with drawers, a book case, a big desk, and a comfy sofa to relax on. Although the room offers more space than you probably need, you can also just hang out in the cozy living room. But the best place has to be the back yard, which Laura turned in a little green oasis. It's the ideal spot to relax after a long day, enjoy the sun, or have a home dinner. And no need to feel lonely as Lulu - a.k.a. the most adorable cat ever - and his buddies from the block are always around somewhere (especially if you give them some of your ham sandwich or sushi). \r\n\r\nI've stayed at Laura's for several months and I've never felt so at home in another person's house. Laura went above and beyond to make my stay as pleasant as possible. I was new to Montreal (actually I was new to Canada) and didn't know any people other than a few colleagues. Laura embraced me as a friend and made sure I never had to feel alone or get bored, while also giving me all the privacy I wanted. \r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood has everything you need. The house is near  shops, supermarkets, cafe's, restaurants, parks (including the Mont Royal), several busstops, 2 metro stations (Laurier & Mont Royal; both 10 min walking distance), and there's and there's always some fun - often free - festival around the corner in the summer.

There was a grocery store across the street and lots of bus stops nearby. The metro was only a 7-10 minute walk away. It\u2019s ground level, so it makes traveling with large luggage bags pretty easy. Milton, the cat, was friendly and gentle. Laura made excellent company as well. About as close to a perfect host you could get; never too overbearing and yet great to make conversation with. The room was bigger than I thought it was going to be! Even though Montreal is hot and humid it was never uncomfortable, the fan provided in the room did the trick for me. There were a couple instances where the door was locked from the inside, but it was never a huge problem. Laura was easy to get in contact with and surprisingly quick to reply, no matter what time of day it was. It didn\u2019t make my stay any less incredible.

He was very responsive to our communication and helpful in providing direction once our flight landed.  He even provided us with the written directions in Cantonese in case our taxi driver didn\u2019t speak English (which came in very handy!).\r\n\r\nRicky had his cousin meet us at a College which was 10 minutes from the airport.  His cousin was very friendly and helpful \u2013 he even arrived with a cart to carry our bags to the apartment.   As there are no vehicles that directly access Ricky\u2019s neighbourhood, there was a lovely 5 minute walk on a beautiful path which weaved through the jungle.  \r\n\r\nUpon arrival at Ricky\u2019s building, it was clear that the place was very clean and well kept.  He provided us with some water bottles, offered us dinner, and his 2 friendly cats entertained us while he checked us in.  He proceeded to show us the rooftop terrace which is a great spot to hang out and enjoy the view of the mountains.  There is also an area to wash and hang dry your laundry up there.\r\n\r\nThe room appeared to be recently renovated.  It was small, but it was very clean and efficiently laid out.  There was good A/C to keep cool as well as a TV with some basic cable for some entertainment.\r\n\r\nOverall, this was a perfect place nearby the airport to spend the night before continuing our travels.  The price was fair, and I would highly recommend staying here. \r\n\r\n"}, {"_id": "107696381", "date": {"$date": 1476158400000}, "listing_id": "10240767", "reviewer_id": "3682451", "reviewer_name": "Luca", "comments": "Location is 5 minutes nice walk away from main road, in the middle of the threes and bridges on a very small village.

Ricky was able to pick us up for a small charge, which I would highly recommend since it otherwise would be difficult to find this property if you are not familiar with the area.\n\nWe woke up the first day and Ricky and his colleague provided us with maps and directions in both English and Cantonese. Furthermore, they gave us a walking tour around the property as well as highlighted all the main attractions in and around their area. \n\nI would also recommend this property to anyone who is interested in going to Hong Kong Disneyland as it has a close proximity to the Metro Station and local bus routes. \n\nAll in all, Ricky and his friend were very friendly, professional, and informative. They spoke very clear English and were very helpful in both providing us with extremely personalized customer service. Again, I would highly recommend this property to anyone.

Our flight arrived at 11:45pm and left the next day at 10:15am. Ricky was great about communicating with me from beginning to end. He answered all my questions super fast! Even though I had a somewhat late arrival, his cousin Terry met us and had a dolly for our luggage. His place is like this hidden oasis. You take this cool walk through all these fruit trees. It looks like a forest! It's off the beaten path, but that's what adds to it's charm and appeal. When you get to his place, it's quiet and you feel like you're away from the hustle and bustle, but you're really not. \n\nThe room that we stayed in had a separate entrance from the house, so it was like we had our own apartment,  minus the kitchen. My boyfriend and I each had a backpack and a carry on suitcase. The room was a bit tight for us and our stuff, but it was manageable. It was clean, cozy and comfortable. It had all the amenities you would need...towels, soap, shampoo, comfy and clean bed, heat or AC (which we didn't use), safe place, and privacy. The room was just what we needed. We had our own bed and restroom. It was clean and it was close to the airport. Plus, there's wifi! Since I arrived kind of late, I texted Ricky about the wifi and he got back to me right away! \n\nThen, on our departure day, Terry had arranged a taxi for us and saw us off. It was like VIP service without the VIP price.  Overall, you can't go wrong by booking with Ricky and Terry. These guys know what they're doing. Their place is just what you need...if it's for one night or more...you'll get great hosts with a great place to stay. Don't wait...just book with them!

A little off the beaten path, but the 10min walk is totally worth it. The village and scenery are beautiful. Ricky and his cousin worked everything out perfectly. From meeting us at the pickup point (with a rolling cart for outlet bags) to arranging a cab to pick us up for our departure, the communication was excellent. We were told all about the town and some great recommendations for close places to visit and eat. I would highly recommend staying here, either for a close place by the airport between flights or for a few days to explore. \n\nThanks for everything, \nAbby & Jae \n"}, {"_id": "149171378", "date": {"$date": 1493697600000}, "listing_id": "10240767", "reviewer_id": "121195428", "reviewer_name": "Yogendra", "comments": "Our flight landed late night, we took a taxi to reach Ricky's place.

It is everything their ad says and more. It really is about as far removed from the Honolulu tourist bustle as one can get. This is a huge bonus to experience Hawaii and a place to live and enjoy the people and untouched beaches along the Waianae Coast.  The Waianae Harbor is just down the road and is where many people from the Waikiki hotels get bused an hour to board the boats to go out for turtle and dolphin cruises.  But, you will be right there! The condo tower community is much more resort like than other condos (minus a restaurant on property), but with the many local restaurants nearby you will never get bored with the eating out options. The condo in modern with all the essential elements. The bathroom is large, the bed is comfy. This is one of the rare units with a screen front door so you can open it up to enjoy a cross breeze if desired and not get attacked by mosquitoes. The view is fantastic. Laundry is just down the hall. I highly recommend Ray and Lise's place!\n\nA word about Handicap Access: If you are handicap and need to avoid stairs, be sure to bring your handicap placard from your car so they give you a special pass to park in the resident parking. I have a bum knee so stairs are not my friend. The standard visitor parking in on the lowest level and is a bit of a hike and many stairs which is no issue for most travelers. There are no handicap parking stalls; all are on a first come basis so if you get back late at night, parking can be a challenge, but you can still avoid stairs by walking in a different door/elevator and making your way to the condo. The pool is three flights of stairs down; no elevator options. But, if you drive your car around to the pool there is a ramp up to the BBQ area to eliminate most of the stairs but you will still have about 10 steps up yo the pool to deal with. Unfortunately there is no wheelchair access to the pool.

The grounds on the property are very pretty.  We experienced no noise issues while we were there.  The staff at this facility are very very friendly and we had no issues with checking in and getting around the property.  \nRay and Lise have beach chairs, coolers and umbrellas, snorkelling gear and books for their guests to use as needed. This was very helpful for us when we spent time at the beaches!\nRay and Lise\u2019s communication throughout the booking process and leading up to the trip was impeccable. They answered all questions i had and were very quick to offer advise for our stay.  We knew exactly what to expect and were not caught off guard by anything when we arrived at their condo.  \nOverall this place is 5/5 for us and it was an experience we will never forget."}, {"_id": "353176289", "date": {"$date": 1543208400000}, "listing_id": "10266175", "reviewer_id": "224560853", "reviewer_name": "Anthony", "comments": "Great place to stay away from the touristy parts of the island.

And the fact that it was a 5 minute drive from Volcano park was the icing on the cake. Mike is a real gentleman, informative, kind, and easy to contact. We will not forget the cherished experience he afforded. \n\n\nWe particularly enjoyed the cabin's  rare blend of rustic charm and meticulously maintained, modern elegance. The beautiful wood interior with exposed beams, light scent of cedar, old-fashioned fireplace, and free-standing antique tub, all made the cabin incredibly charming. The wrap-around porch was not only scenic, but very quiet and mosquito free. It was a wonderful place to chat in the evenings, read selections from the bookshelf, and to enjoy the delicious breakfast items provided, including fresh papaya. Since the cabin resides at the end of the residential area, the only thing visible for miles from the back porch was lush, pristine forest. The cabin's enveloping sense of privacy was relaxing and romantic. \n\nWith respect to the cabin's modern appeal, where does one begin? Even the toaster lowered the bread automatically. One can enjoy coffee prepared by three different methods, including French press, and Mike made sure we had ample amounts of freshly ground coffee. The stainless steel fridge was packed with complementary goodies as well. Being expert snackers, we were quite pleased. \n\nThis understood, the modern conveniences went far beyond food. We enjoyed being able to dim the lights just the right amount in each room to create the desired ambiance. The king-sized bed in the loft was incredibly comfortable and featured three types of pillows, including a memory foam option. But the aspect of our stay we liked the most had to do with the modern architecture of the cabin itself. The walls of the A-frame design, both behind the bed and in front of it, feature large windows with breathtaking views of the forest. As a result, the typical distinction between interior and exterior does not apply. The effect was magical. Waking up in the morning, we were in awe. \n\nThanks again for everything, Mike.

This house was modern with beautiful furniture, gorgeous floors, and beautiful bathtub/sinks/counters. There are so many windows. There is an L-shaped wrap around deck that is massive. We spent almost all of our time sitting out there on the comfortable patio furniture, listening to the jungle, drinking our freshly prepared 100% Hawaiin coffee that our host provided.

We never even saw any.) \n\nSpeaking of what the host provided for us: coffee, tea, oats, pancake mix, butter, sugar, syrup, fresh jam, eggs, orange juice, milk, chocolate, yogurt, and fruit.

Er hat zudem ein grosses Wissen \u00fcber einheimische Pflanzen und Tiere, die er einem gerne weitergibt.\nEr geht praktisch jeden Morgen zum Vulkan. Er hat mich spontan um 05 30 fr\u00fchmorgends zum \"glow\"  mitgenommen (leuchten der Magma, am besten b Sonnen auf oder -Untergang sichtbar). Danach haben wir in der Milit\u00e4r- basis im Park gefr\u00fchst\u00fcckt und \u00fcber \"Gott ind die Welt\" gesprochen. \nThanks for all that, dear Mike. I appreciated my stay a lot.

The cabin is completely secluded but only a short drive from the highway. Just over the highway there are several restaurants and convenience stores. We really enjoyed dinner at the Kilauea Lodge. \n\nThe cabin itself is beautiful and charming. Mike has thought of absolutely everything and was very attentive to any needs we had.

Mike provides a really nice spread for breakfast though (we had eggs, granola, yogurt, fresh papaya, english muffins, local spreads and jams, and a myriad of other things to fill us up), so chances are you won't need to buy much. Mike even dropped off a warm loaf of pumpkin bread one morning!\r\n\r\nMike seems to have thought of everything you could possibly need while at his place - he has binoculars, headlamps and maps available for trips to the park, lots of blankets to keep you warm, and he even offered to start a fire for us.

This is the perfect place to stay if you want a romantic spot to relax and check out the volcano. \r\n\r\n"}, {"_id": "122180237", "date": {"$date": 1482296400000}, "listing_id": "10280433", "reviewer_id": "23141385", "reviewer_name": "Samantha", "comments": "Mike is a delightfully pleasant and affable host with an almost heavenly place in the clouds you get the pleasure of sharing for a while. There are so many things to say here, but I'll just focus on the two most important and overarching areas of interest: the host and the home. The most accurate description I can relinquish of this host (Mike) is that he was kind, organized, informed, and impressively meticulous in his attention to detail. We actually ran into him by coincidence while out hiking the VNP trails and we were glad to share in part of a hike with him to have the chance to get to know him better. Our brief Mike-guided tour was just a nice bonus as he is an admirable conversationalist with an interesting life and is very knowledgeable of the VNP area. We have personally ranked him as our overall best host in all of our AirBnB stays to date, and that is saying a lot as we have been very fortunate to have nearly all positive experiences via AirBnB. Albeit, Mike sets the bar really high; the previous makes sense given he basically lives in the clouds in the shadow of a volcano. The home was incredible and in retrospect remains our favorite place we stayed this year on the islands of Hawaii and Maui (out of 7 other homes and/or hotels). Mike has obviously placed a lot of consideration into this offering and continues to build upon a rock solid foundation of thoughtful hosting. He easily supplies every utensil, comfort, amenity, and convenience you could expect and/or want in this upscaled cabin. There are all the expected and unexpected kitchen fixings, a small library in a large wall-shelf filled with Hawaii-centric materials, several dehumidifiers, music and lighting that just delivers a very creature-comfort cabin experience, and a slew of other add-ons provided to make life just a little easier on your trip. The interior of this house has so many fine things it's hard to list but our personal favorites were the 100-year old clawfoot tub (also functions as a standing shower), the tempur-pedic bed and ultra comfortable bedding, and last but not least the carefully selected combinations of wood all throughout the house, which make it feel like it's both somewhere old and somewhere new to its guest as well as blends the home into its earthy and forested setting just outside the glass doors. The lanai wraps around the unit and makes for an amazingly tranquil place to eat a meal or listen and watch the rain. The surrounding area is residential but spread out and Mike's place seems like it's in own little universe, tucked between the trees. We found the flying cloud was easy to find (via GPS) and an absolutely perfect spot for those looking to enjoy the VNP as its very close (<10mins) and makes for a seems-to-good-to-be-true home base. There are plenty of other things I could continue on to say in..."}, {"_id": "122743156", "date": {"$date": 1482642000000}, "listing_id": "10280433", "reviewer_id": "6068562", "reviewer_name": "Srihari", "comments": "The best bnb experience we ever had - Mike's warm hospitality, the sound and view of the rainforest surrounding the cabin, the cabin itself (well designed, open, clean and well stocked), and the proximity to the National park.\n\nMike is a very friendly and warm person.

It is so close to Volcano National Park but still feels very secluded, like you are in the middle of the rainforest (which you are!). It is even more beautiful than the pictures and I cannot recommend it highly enough. \n\nMike is the definition of above and beyond. From waiting in the driveway with an umbrella to carry our bags and protect us from the rain upon our arrival to dropping off freshly baked pumpkin bread one morning, he thinks of everything and is a very kind and considerate person. This was by far the most thorough check-in I've ever had on AirBnB, as he walked us through every detail of the cottage that we would need to know, including the many different approaches to coffee-making that were available! I'm sure he would have been happy to help if we had any questions, but he was so thorough in explanations of not only the cottage but also the national park and the Volcano community that we never had any. He obviously loves this cottage very much and you will too. \n\nMy only tip is that it does get cool in the mornings and evenings. Mike warned us about this and provided firewood, a space heater and fluffy robes so it's not a problem, but my tip is to make bring some warm lounge-wear to make the mornings and evenings even cosier, which not everybody would think about planning a trip to Hawaii.

The home appeared clean but the host was clearly obsessed and spent a full hour telling us the do's & don'ts, while our dinners got cold and we were shivering on the porch... Ex: don't cook steak (no ventilation), don't leave the bathroom door open (humidity issue), don't wear shoes in the house, don't bring your suitcases upstairs to the bedroom, don't be concerned that the bedroom has no curtains, don't use the lights or the space heater too much because electricity is expensive in Hawaii, don't be alarmed to see the host working in the yard during our stay, and don't be alarmed if the host comes into the house while we're gone to get his yard tools, and on and on for an hour.  The whole experience was bizarre and uncomfortable.  The host wouldn't leave until we told him we had heard enough, that it was very late, that our dinners were now cold and so were we, and our groceries were sitting on the counter unpacked.  About an hour after the host finally left, my husband attempted to bathe and fell in the tub.  He could barely get out of the tub without falling again.  In all our stays in private homes and hotels, we have never previously experienced a tub so slippery.

We missed viewing the first night because we hit some fog but were able to return the following night to an intensely beautiful milky way/night sky contrasted with the glorious glow of Kilauea. Although Volcano is remote, it is a great set up to check out the green and black sand beaches. Mike is so thoughtful and aware of some of the limitations of the small town, he provided a wonderful little spread so that we might enjoy home-cooked breakfast and teas. He also has an extensive coffee setup for coffee folks as well. We slept very well and there are extra touches like comfortable bedding and thick towels that show Mike's put a lot of thought into folks' stays. It does get chilly in volcano but he's got that covered too; there is rain gear, a little stove that can be lit and small space heater if the temps dip.

He even lit a fire in the wood burning stove because he knew we were coming and it was raining out.

Would stay again in the future, as such great value for money (and doesn't feel like your staying a shoe box, like most of NYC). Would be perfect for families. Thanks!

We took Ade up on some recommended places to eat and they were all great local places, well researched.\r\n\r\nIt was easy walking distance to all points of interest in Williamsburg, from the vintage market to the regular street food festival and East River Ferry, providing access to other parts of Brooklyn, downtown NYC and Governor's Island.  \r\n\r\nThe short walk to different subways meant getting into the city was very fast, particularly areas such as East Village and Park Slope.  We regularly went from the heart of the city back to the apartment within 20-30 minutes, a good escape when the crowds got too much in  Manhattan.\r\n\r\nAde welcomed in and helped us up with the bags on day 1.  There is no lift but compared to subways, a few flights of stairs was not a problem.

There's a medium size flat screen TV in the bedroom, with Netflix, and the internet wifi connection, which is immensely important to me as a tech guy on the go, was lightning fast.\r\n\r\nThe building is a little old and unkept, but don't let that scare you - the apartment is in perfect condition. Do be aware that it's on the 4th floor and the stairwell is quite steep, so don't stay here if you have a disability or very small children.\r\n\r\nThe most wonderful thing about the apartment is the neighbourhood. Williamsburg is charming, and there are numerous cafes, bars and restaurants literally a few steps away. I particularly liked \"Samurai Mama\" and \"Snacky\", check them out if you're into Asian food. There's also the Williamsburg Music Hall and the Knitting Factory - well known venues where you can sample the local rock bands. And, importantly, the streets felt to me safe enough to walk around alone at night.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is a few minutes away from the subway station where you can take the L train to Manhattan - a few stations away.\r\n\r\nAde herself was friendly and very helpful. I found her to be the perfect host - responsive enough when I needed her, but she didn't bother me at all when I didn't.\r\n\r\nI travel to NYC a lot, and I will be more than happy to stay at Ade's again next time I get there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}, {"_id": "23744335", "date": {"$date": 1418101200000}, "listing_id": "103161", "reviewer_id": "10609989", "reviewer_name": "Dani", "comments": "Passei dez dias com meu marido no apartamento de Adela em Williamsburg.

The apartment is less than a half a block off of Bedford at a location that has a lot of good local bars and restaurants.  We felt very safe though there is a vacant lot that you could walk by on her street.  However, we did not make much of it, but you could walk on the other side of the street if that bothers you.  The street is well lit.  We worried a little about noise given Williamsburg's reputation for hipness.  However, this ended up not being a problem.  Restaurants were still open after 9, but you could still walk into them without reservations.  At night, it was busy enough to feel safe, but it was sparse enough for it to be farely quiet.\n\nGetting into Manhattan can be an issue.  The L train is the only train coming into the neighborhood.  If it isn't running, the closest stop is Marcy at the end of the Williamsburg bridge which is probably a 30 minute walk.  The ferry, which is a bargain, is close and will cross the East River and drop you off at 34th close to the UN Building.  However, it does not run after 9:30 in the evening.\n\nAde's building is a little ratty which you will see in the stairwell.  However, her apartment is perfectly fine.  The bed is comfortable which is nice compared to most Air BNB hosts.  There is a window unit AC for the entire apartment.  Depending on the time of year, I am not sure if it will cool the bedroom well since it's in a different part of the apartment (though there is an oscillating fan there).  We did not have a problem since it was October.  There is no microwave oven.  It is four flights up with pretty large stairs and no elevator.  I would avoid this apartment if you are elderly or handicapped.\n\nWe did not meet Ade which it is getting pretty common not to meet the host.  However, we had no problems.  The process to get the key was easy.  She had recommendations printed and posted in the room, and she was quick to respond to questions by messaging.\n\nFor our purposes, this was a great place to consider if the L train is running.  We would not stay her again if the L train isn't running.  However, if you don't mind working around the ferry schedule and you want to visit Williamsburg and Greenpoint, this will work well for you."}, {"_id": "354879082", "date": {"$date": 1543726800000}, "listing_id": "103161", "reviewer_id": "42046158", "reviewer_name": "Jeff", "comments": "Great location!"}, {"_id": "414047344", "date": {"$date": 1550466000000}, "listing_id": "103161", "reviewer_id": "39745252", "reviewer_name": "Rachel", "comments": "Ade\u2019s apartment was clean, cozy, and in the heart of Williamsburg.

We chose this location for our intimate wedding ceremony and casual dinner for about 45 friends and family. We originally planned both the ceremony and dinner outdoors, but due to the unusually windy weather, we decided to host the dinner in the spacious living room instead, which worked out great. Noah was very responsive and helpful before we arrived in Hawaii, as well as throughout the wedding weekend. Unlike previous reviewers, we had no issues with the hot water, the floors were clean when we arrived, and flies only became an issue when we left the doors open for long periods of time. There wasn't any sand on the beach in early March, but the water was calm and protected - perfect for wading around with water shoes. The house was fully stocked with amenities, and in a fantastic location if you're looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki and Honolulu. I would highly recommend staying at Noah's beach house, and hope to find another reason to stay again in the future.

Both the bedroom and living room have air conditioners.\r\n\r\nThe little apartment is on the 6th floor of an old and dingy (but clean) Kowloon apartment building one block from the stunning fountains of Kowloon Park and the subway, and a million places right there in your face.  It is a 10 minute exciting walk (as in every single time its exciting) to the picturesque  harbor ferry to Hong Kong Island (or you can take the subway there).  Like many Asian buildings, the elevators are very slow and often crowded with friendly people, but remarkably, each floor has an elevator on either end of the hallway. You walk out of Jenkin's apartment, look left and look right to see which elevator will arrive first, a fun little game for us. \r\n\r\nThe very safe neighborhood is extremely trendy, filled with excited locals and tourists, and many places open until late. (My favorite bar and restaurant were open until 3am, both very funky). \r\n\r\nI might stay in one of Jenkin's larger units next time but, you know, I'm not sure since this little place just grows on you after two days.  He is a master host, his cleaning lady is so nice and right nearby, and he takes a lot of pride in making your stay high quality.  He even guided our taxi driver to the front door by cell phone, and he is always, always accessible.  It's remarkable. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}, {"_id": "73506770", "date": {"$date": 1462680000000}, "listing_id": "10343118", "reviewer_id": "65460950", "reviewer_name": "Jj", "comments": "\u6211\u4eec\u53bb\u73a9\u8fea\u58eb\u5c3c\u5f88\u665a\u56de\u6765\u5bb3\u6015\u8981\u627e\u4e00\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4,\u5730\u7406\u4ea4\u901a\u6761\u4ef6\u597d\u51fa\u5730\u94c1\u53e3\u8d70\u51e0\u6b65\u5c31\u5230\u4e86,\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u5c31\u80fd\u627e\u5230\uff61\u53bb\u7ef4\u591a\u5229\u4e9a\u6e2f\u770b\u5b8c\u591c\u666f\u56de\u6765\u5230\u697c\u4e0b\u6709\u4fbf\u5229\u5e97\u8336\u9910\u5385\u5403\u70b9\u4e1c\u897f\u975e\u5e38\u65b9\u4fbf,\u623f\u5b50\u611f\u89c9\u536b\u751f,\u6709\u7535\u89c6\u548c\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u6574\u4f53\u611f\u89c9\u4e0d\u9519!"}, {"_id": "74234498", "date": {"$date": 1463198400000}, "listing_id": "10343118", "reviewer_id": "31011591", "reviewer_name": "Alan", "comments": "The apartment is in a great location for exploring the Tsim Sha Sui area. The MTR station is right outside the building entrance, and the harbor area is just a few blocks away to the south and west. The living space is small but well organized, with a separate bedroom (just big enough for the bed) with its own air-con, and the bathroom is a very usable size. The main drawback to the apartment is that it is on the 6th floor of a 15 floor building and the queues can get long for the elevator. There is one elevator at each end of the long hall on the 6th floor but on the ground level they are completely separated.  A few times I waited on the ground floor in a queue for 15-20 minutes and the elevator fills up before being able to get in, so plan your trips, don't expect to go in and out a lot, and avoid mid-day and evening hours when people are coming home.  Of course this is not an issue the host can resolve, but I think any guests should anticipate."}, {"_id": "74369812", "date": {"$date": 1463284800000}, "listing_id": "10343118", "reviewer_id": "69166808", "reviewer_name": "\u66e6\u5b50", "comments": "\u5730\u7406\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5f88\u68d2 (Hidden by Airbnb) \u90fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u65b9\u4fbf"}, {"_id": "76222226", "date": {"$date": 1464148800000}, "listing_id": "10343118", "reviewer_id": "70462561", "reviewer_name": "\u5927\u83ef", "comments": "\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5341\u5206\u65b9\u4fbf \u8fd1\u5730\u9435\u7ad9 \u5546\u5834 \u665a\u4e0a\u5403\u6771\u897f\u90fd\u65b9\u4fbf\r\n\u623f\u9593\u6709\u9ede\u5c0f  \u6d74\u5ba4\u66f4\u5c0f  \u6709\u8a31\u591a\u96dc\u7269\u5806\u653e\u5728\u6ac3\u5b50\u88e1  \u6253\u6383\u4e5f\u4e0d\u4e7e\u6de8  \u6c99\u767c\u4e0a\u6709\u9700\u591a\u982d\u9aee  \u5783\u573e\u6876\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u500b  \u56e0\u70ba\u4e0d\u77e5\u53bb\u54ea\u5012  \u5c0d\u65c5\u884c\u7684\u7684\u4eba\u4f86\u8aaa \u4e0d\u5920\u4f7f\u7528   \r\n\u6d74\u5ba4\u4e00\u6c96\u6c34 \u6d74\u7c3e\u5c31\u6703\u4e82\u98c4 \u5e38\u6703\u9ecf\u5230\u8eab\u4e0a  \u8001\u5be6\u8aaa\u4ee5\u623f\u9593\u7684\u50f9\u683c\u9084\u662f\u6253\u904e\u6298\u7684  \u4e0d\u5982\u4f4f\u98ef\u5e97  \u65e2\u6c92\u6709\u50f9\u683c\u512a\u52e2  \u74b0\u5883\u4e5f\u4e0d\u592aok  "}, {"_id": "77360245", "date": {"$date": 1464667200000}, "listing_id": "10343118", "reviewer_id": "44915148", "reviewer_name": "Jesse", "comments": "Host was very friendly and accommodating!

It was literally at the corner of the TST station which was convenient to go to ANYwhere, not to mention all those places and attractions you must visit right around the area.

The place is very clean and with complete home stuffs like microwave, ref, tissues, towels, etc. feels like your at your home. Don't expect that the place is big, but if you're staying for travel only the place is perfect for you, and compare with the HK standard the apartment was big unlike the other hostels in HK which has only 10-11sqm. 4persons can fit the room If we'd visit HK again, i would definitely stay here again.

Lovely Kowloon Park is very close by as well. The building is older, but it does have an elevator. \nThe apartment is really just a room that is divided into a tiny sleeping area with a sliding glass panel and curtain. There is no kitchen just a fridge, hot water kettle and some dishes, cups, etc. There is no place to even wash cups or dishes other than the bathroom. The apartment is nicely renovated and decorated and the bed and couch are comfortable. The shower pressure is good. It is in a busy shopping and restaurant area but it was quiet enough at night for us to sleep with earplugs. \nWe had a problem at check in. We needed an early check in and I asked for this before booking. Phoebe, the co-host assured me several times that we could arrive early and I reconfirmed the time after I booked it. Unfortunately, Phoebe did not tell her assistant and we arrived to find ourselves locked out. We messaged James and the only response we got was to contact Phoebe. Phoebe couldn\u2019t be reached- later when we spoke she explained that she had lost her phone for a period of time. She was very apologetic and brought us a bottle of wine. No corkscrew in the apartment but still nice of her. The next day we were able to store our luggage for a couple of hours without a problem. \n\nThis place is nice but understand that it is basically a hotel room. I don\u2019t know the prices of hotels in that area but I suspect they\u2019re much higher.

Quite a shock to find them in our kitchen, but luckily they were just friendly and confused tourists. The whole building seems to be just 4-5 apartments rented only to tourists.

The cottage is very comfortable and equipped with everything you need.   The space is open and roomy, even more so than the listing pics suggest.   As with many Hawaiian dwellings, there are lots of windows, and the cottage offers an open air, indoor/outdoor style of living.   \r\n\r\nAlso of note: the bed is new and king-sized, and is super comfortable-- one of the best I've slept on lately.  Its wonderfully supportive and guarantees a great night's sleep.  Internet access and speeds were very good, something of a priority for me.   Washer and drier out the back door was also a plus.   Out the front door is a picnic table  (put to good use everyday),  and a shady sitting area under a blooming Hong Kong Orchid tree-- delightful.\r\n\r\nThe cottage basically sits on its own parcel, with your own private driveway, and so it offers good privacy.   The location is somewhat off the beaten path, which I found desirable, as areas of the North Shore can get busy at times.  Still, there's easy access to area beaches, shopping in Haleiwa, the weekend farmer's market's, etc.   And then there's literally miles of amazing beaches to explore from the cottage to Ka'ena Point.   \r\n\r\nSaving the best for last: Bobby and Mike are excellent hosts and genuinely lovely people-- the aloha spirit here is awesome.  Both are very friendly and  accommodating,  generously sharing weekend BBQ dishes (delicious!) and providing a fresh pineapple to welcome their guest.

The area is so safe you don't need to shut the doors and it is quiet as anything-except for the wild roosters, but these are everywhere in Hawaii and you get used to them very quickly.  The beach is a short walk away, and Bobby loaned me a beach cruiser bicycle so I could ride into the North Shore town of Haleiwa which was on bike paths all the way.  The cottage also has a great outdoor shower which is perfect for ending a trip to the beach.\r\n\r\nWaialua is the real Hawaii, it is quiet and away from most of the touristy stuff and it was very nice not to be in Wakiki!  But still only a short drive to historic Haleiwa which has restaurants and shops.  I cooked for myself most evenings in the cottage which was easy enough on the hot plate and the cottage was very peaceful in the evening, with fantastic starts to be watched from the garden after dark.   Bobby also brought me fresh pineapple from the plantation and the mangos at this time of year were so delicious- another fantastic touch!\r\n\r\nI'd really recommend staying with Bobby if you are looking for a peaceful, North Shore, real Hawaii stay.  It was absolutely fantastic-and the bed is massive and super comfortable!  Great value and really super!

Located on the beautiful North Shore, this rental is peaceful and perfectly situated to allow you to have an amazing time exploring the island. Very close to Ka'ena Point, where we saw wild whales migrating off the coast, and to the lovely surf town of Hale'iwa. There's a secluded beach in close walking distance, and we also used our rental car to explore some of the incredible beaches within a short drive, like Waimea Bay. The space itself was clean and well-equipped, with a very comfortable king size bed! Bobby was very easy to communicate with and we felt so well taken care of, right down to the arrival treats that were left for us (very appreciated after a long flight!). I'll echo what some others have mentioned here, which is to bring earplugs for nighttime sleeping, as there are junglefowl all over the island (wild chickens!) and the roosters do like to announce their presence at all hours - you'll hear this everywhere you go.

Just like the ad described, it has its own driveway and completely private space, the adjacent houses were even separated by a fence.  The space was clean, comfortable, and well stocked with games, towels, snacks, and other supplies. I wish we didn't have to run around so much that weekend so that we could have enjoyed the cottage more. We didn't even get to cut open the fresh pineapple that Bobby left for us! Although I did enjoy the crackers and peanut butter :) \n\nThis is the perfect weekend getaway for locals, or vacation spot for out of towners looking for a peaceful getaway. If you want to be be closer to the hustle and bustle, then I would look for a place closer to Haleiwa or Sunset. It is pretty quiet here (minus the roosters in the am), and other than the beach, it is not really walking distance to much. Which we loved actually :) Also, I really appreciated that Bobby was readily available to help with directions and check-in details, but more importantly that she gave us privacy and space once we checked in. \n\nIf I ever need to come back up the North Shore for a relaxing weekend, I would certainly book again!

The bungalow is clean, open, and roomy, with a giant, comfortable California King size bed in the middle and a kitchen housing all the essentials (glasses, plates, silverware, coffee maker, ice trays, etc.). \n\nThere is also a television and WiFi available, which we used to connect to Spotify for some music. But oh, the sounds, the sounds, the sounds!\n\nI actually chose this reservation because of the reviews which described the sounds of the North Shore. I love chickens and birds and grew up with their gentle AM serenades, therefore this place was perfect. The roosters sang to impress while other birds crooned and cackled, creating a beautiful medley of island sounds that makes this place unique.\n\nThere is a giant yard and private gate on the outside of the bungalow, and an outdoor shower which was perfect for hosing off all the sand from the luscious beach. \n\nAnd the beach, what a beach it was! Upon arrival Bobby and her partner greeted us with a fresh pineapple and gave us directions to the ocean and encouraged us to use their cruiser bicycles. The beach is about a ten-minute walk or a three-minute bike ride -- either journey is pleasant, with the bike ride maybe being better because it gets you there faster.\n\nPicture all the noise and umbrellas and kayaks and floaties of Waikiki Beach, and all the surfers and gatherers of those at say, Banzai Pipeline, and then picture the exact opposite. The beach in this spot was quiet, with gentle, clean waves and at most I saw a maximum of about eight other people who were either snorkeling or just hanging out with dogs.\n\nAt one point, after relaxing on the beach for so long, my partner and I took a nap and were awakened by a friendly pooch named Tucker, who was all smiles as we gave him pets and ear scratches (sorry if that was TMI, we are dog people after all).\n\nI could yam on and on about this place, but I think I've done all the yamming I could possible yam.\n\nI give this place ten stars out of five, and the hosts also ten stars out of five.\n\nDid I mention we really enjoyed our stay?"}, {"_id": "152686437", "date": {"$date": 1494993600000}, "listing_id": "10392282", "reviewer_id": "6031468", "reviewer_name": "Hannah", "comments": "My Husband and I absolutely loved out stay in Bobby's Bungalow.

Very nice, spacious and ideal for a couple. The place is very well decorated, a nice large bed and enough room to really make you feel at home. Very private setting, including private access and parking.\nThe host was very accomodating and communication was nearly immediate. In fact, on our last morning I texted to let her know we'd be going for a quick snorkle at Wiamea Bay (15 min drive) and back by 9:30 to check out at 10. She was gracious enough to allow for a later checkout which turned out to be marvelous. \nYou must have a car to stay here. No public transportation available and Uber would be potentially challenging.\nThe beach at the end of the street (down the street, take a right for a short distance) was fantastic for a semi-private location with good swimming. The water is fairly shallow with ok snorkeling. Bikes had flat tires so we drove. Not a huge deal. \nThe Roosters - I have to say that as charming as the chickens and chicks are that roam the North Shore (we have some at home), the roosters are quite challenging in the mornings, and for certain guests, this could be a deal breaker for this particular location. We did have one night that a couple in the neighborhood tested their vocal cords at 3:30 am for a few minutes. I'd be lying if I didn't say that I wanted to strangle a few of them, but we were up and going each morning anyway so this wasn't a deal breaker for us. \nWe loved this location and would stay again."}, {"_id": "243983470", "date": {"$date": 1521259200000}, "listing_id": "10392282", "reviewer_id": "140981747", "reviewer_name": "Mike", "comments": "This bungalow is quiet and accommodating.

Uma consequ\u00eancia disso eh que tive que gastar 30 euros com liga\u00e7\u00f5es telef\u00f4nicas usando um chip franc\u00eas quando cheguei no aeroporto para me comunicar com ela e perguntar coisas b\u00e1sicas que n\u00e3o foram informadas: n\u00famero da rua, com quem pegar\u00edamos a chave, o hor\u00e1rio em que poder\u00edamos entrar etc\n- al\u00e9m disso, apesar de ter usado o Airbnb in\u00fameras vezes, essa \u00e9 a primeira vez que ningu\u00e9m nos recebeu. N\u00e3o vimos a anfitri\u00e3 ou a ag\u00eancia que ela contrata ou outra pessoa em nenhum momento. N\u00f3s chegamos, pedimos as chaves ao porteiro, a maneira de abrir a garagem, onde estacionar, por onde entrar quando chegamos da praia etc. Fomos perguntando quando as d\u00favidas surgiam pq ningu\u00e9m nos fez uma apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o do lugar. Eles vendem um servi\u00e7o como se fosse um produto, e sem muito atendimento ao cliente.\n- o lugar estava empoeirado. Nitidamente ningu\u00e9m realizou uma limpeza previa \u00e0 nossa chegada. N\u00e3o era nada gritante,  mas bolas de poeira e sujeira no ch\u00e3o do quarto e embaixo dos m\u00f3veis podiam ser vistas com facilidade\n- a cafeteira estava quebrada, e como eu n\u00e3o tinha muita esperan\u00e7a de que algu\u00e9m se dispusesse a ir at\u00e9 l\u00e1, resolvi comprar uma cafeteira por 80 reais, que depois deixamos com familiares no RJ. O objetivo n\u00e3o era de compr\u00e1-la, mas devido aos fatos expostos acima fizemos um c\u00e1lculo de custo/benef\u00edcios e nos resignamos na compra de uma cafeteira que n\u00e3o precisar\u00edamos depois\n- o ar condicionado dos quartos tem apenas dois modos: desligado ou frio glacial, o que nos for\u00e7a a ligar e desligar constantemente pra manter uma temperatura razo\u00e1vel, inclusive no meio da noite. Em um dos quartos ele \u00e9 bem barulhento. O ar condicionado da sala tamb\u00e9m tem dois modos apenas: desligado ou fraquinho, o que \u00e9 particularmente chato quando se est\u00e1 na cozinha quente que n\u00e3o se resfria com ele (a cozinha \u00e9 americana e d\u00e1 sobre a sala)\n- por \u00faltimo, mas isso \u00e9 menos importante pq a piscina fecha cedo, quando algu\u00e9m nada nela uma das varandas treme bastante, o que reverbera sobre o quarto, fazendo um barulho como se algu\u00e9m no andar de cima estivesse pulando.\n\nEm resumo, o apartamento em si \u00e9 bom, mas a aus\u00eancia quase total de manuten\u00e7\u00e3o e algu\u00e9m pra auxiliar com coisas t\u00e3o simples como apresentar o lugar, informar hor\u00e1rios, dizer o endere\u00e7o exato, dizer as regras do lugar, substituir uma cafeteira quebrada ou limpar o apartamento de vez em quando faz com que ele esteja caro para o servi\u00e7o prestado.\n\nEsperamos ter ajudado outras pessoas a tomar uma escolha s\u00e1bia, e tamb\u00e9m esperamos que a anfitri\u00e3  se torne mais presente na plataforma e pressione a ag\u00eancia que ela contrata para melhorar determinados pontos do servi\u00e7o proposto.\n\nDanilo & Marine"}]}, {"_id": "10415637", "listing_url": "https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10415637", "name": "(1) Beach Guest House - Go Make A Trip", "summary": "(1) Double Room With Private Bathroom: 1 Double Bed", "space": "Incl: Bathroom, pool table, ping pong table, darts, barbecue area, free surf board, kitchen, air cond, wifi, free parking, hangers, hair dryer, iron, free bike.

If you\u2019re used to relying on transit, look for a place that is closer to the central parts of town. I think of all the buses we took, we had ONE arrive on time. Some showed up 10 minutes after the scheduled time, and one didn\u2019t even show up at all. So, look for something nearer the main harbour or CBD, or you can do like we did a lot of the time: walk down to the Manly Wharf (about 25 min walk) and take the ferry to the main harbour, and only stick to the areas that are closest. Honestly, take the ferries as much as possible. The views are phenomenal. They absolutely -made- the trip for us!"}, {"_id": "260740869", "date": {"$date": 1525492800000}, "listing_id": "10416859", "reviewer_id": "63224541", "reviewer_name": "Daniel", "comments": "Great value for money.

Bondi Beach must be its sister city times two. As a bunch of aged birdwatchers we didn't really fit in but felt comfortable and accepted anyway. Lots of shops and good restaurants within easy walking distance, and the beach is just as close. There's even a funky little nine hole golf course close by. It's perched on a cliff that overlooks the ocean and has million dollar views.\n\nThe house worked well for five adults (one couple and three others) and was clean and well appointed. There are even cookbooks displayed in the kitchen in case you wanted to get adventurous. One of the bedrooms is in a guesthouse in the back yard and it was a nice place for the couple to sleep and be apart form the others. Be prepared for visiting bugs, though.\n\nBelieve Cat when she says that you won't be able to park inside the gate without a high clearance vehicle but you will be able to park in the driveway if your car is on the small side. We had a minivan that was simply too big to allow for pedestrians pushing baby strollers to get by. Parking on the street is for two hours only and the nearest long-term free parking is s few blocks away. Remember to always leave space between you and the next car as locals seem to have no issue with pinning you in if you don't. \n\nCat was great about communicating with us. She seemed available at all times, promptly answering any questions that we had.\n\nEric\nVancouver, WA \nUSA"}, {"_id": "124881102", "date": {"$date": 1483333200000}, "listing_id": "10423504", "reviewer_id": "56832913", "reviewer_name": "Lorraine", "comments": "This accommodation is in a lovely location, quiet close to the beach.

Loved sitting in the beautiful courtyard, sipping champagne and enjoying the fish.\n\nSo many small attentions to detail.... having champagne stoppers, insect repellant and a really helpful guide to the house and how to navigate the surrounding areas. Lovely toiletries and an amazing open fire - yes I had the fire going, not because it was really cold, but because I love an open fire and this was one of the reasons I chose the property.  Cat was very accommodating with this and we had plenty of firewood. The fire burnt and drew well.\n\nGreat location. The house is a very easy walk to Bondi Beach, even for unfit me, and an even shorter walk to groceries, bottle shop, cafe and restaurants.\n\nParking is the only thing that is a bit awkward.  The listing description is accurate in this regard.  If you have a regular size car you will not be able to get into the driveway, which is such a shame.  We were able to get longer stay parking in other streets, but this obviously wasn't as convenient.

The host there was unaffected with our concerns. All of which were half heartedly addressed, if at all.  The house at the rocks where we stayed had a terrible mold problem. My poor son was having asthma attacks. \n\nLuckily, Cat was able to accommodate last minute and she was sure to deal with any concerns we had right away. But we didn\u2019t have any. Everything was great, you won\u2019t be disappointed."}]}, {"_id": "1042446", "listing_url": "https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1042446", "name": "March 2019 availability!

The sound of the ocean and the palm trees at night in the bedroom made for a relaxing way to fall asleep. There are all the needed beach necessities and the kitchen is well appointed. We also enjoyed listening to the Hawaiian Cd's that were available in the apartment. It was a good introduction to the Slack Key style and added to the ambiance.   \r\n\r\nDon't forget to take a walk to the farmer's market and Sugar Beach Bake shop. It was our favorite way to start the morning. There are several supermarkets / drug stores within a 10 minute drive or less should you need anything. \r\n\r\nWe hope to visit again someday soon!

And since we didnt know which flat she was stayign in, we couldnt even tell the guards there, for them to allow us go up. when we asked the guard if there was wifi at the lobby, sadly there was none so we couldnt get into airbnb. so we had to get the local sim card and connect to the internet so i could check my email. thank god her husband mike, left his contact number and flat number via email. basically the timing was so wrong. cant entirely blame it on crystal.  otherwise everything was good. the space was a bit small, location is walking distance from Mongkok East station. So that was really good for moving around. Hardly got to meet crystal but her husband mike was always around  in the evenings. so, he gave us quite a tip to take a cab to go to the airport rather than taking the MTR especially if you have luggage. \r\n\r\nmain tip: take the train to mongkok east, and check your email/airbnb a day before and on the day of arrival in hong kong for updates your host has left for you.

The hosts were lovely and really got us out of a pickle with speedy replies and instant book even though it was late."}, {"_id": "75217066", "date": {"$date": 1463630400000}, "listing_id": "10458796", "reviewer_id": "66228813", "reviewer_name": "Soonsoon", "comments": "\u623f\u95f4\u5f88\u5e72\u51c0,\u623f\u4e1c\u4eba\u4e5f\u5f88\u68d2,\u5468\u56f4\u98df\u8086\u9009\u62e9\u4e5f\u591a,\u54c8\u54c8,\u5f88\u5f00\u5fc3\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u4f53\u9a8c"}, {"_id": "75644658", "date": {"$date": 1463889600000}, "listing_id": "10458796", "reviewer_id": "48488660", "reviewer_name": "Bo", "comments": "Nice host"}, {"_id": "76132127", "date": {"$date": 1464148800000}, "listing_id": "10458796", "reviewer_id": "69133484", "reviewer_name": "Lauren", "comments": "\u623f\u4e1c\u975e\u5e38nice,\u5bf9\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7591\u95ee\u6709\u95ee\u5fc5\u7b54\uff61\u5c4b\u5b50\u5f88\u5e72\u51c0,\u5e8a\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u9002\u5408\u4e24\u4e2a\u4eba\u4f4f\uff61\u5c0f\u5b9d\u5b9d\u5f88\u4e56,\u623f\u95f4\u7684\u9694\u97f3\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u9519,\u867d\u7136\u5b9d\u5b9d\u5076\u5c14\u6709\u54ed,\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u623f\u95f4\u91cc\u4e5f\u4e0d\u4f1a\u542c\u5230\uff61\u5e0c\u671b\u6709\u673a\u4f1a\u518d\u6765,\u795d\u5c0fBB\u5065\u5eb7\u6210\u957f"}, {"_id": "76268177", "date": {"$date": 1464235200000}, "listing_id": "10458796", "reviewer_id": "28032888", "reviewer_name": "\u4f55", "comments": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u7528airbnb\u5c31\u9047\u5230\u4e00\u5c0d\u559c\u6b61\u65c5\u904a\u7684\u623f\u6771,\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u59cb\u7d42\u76f8\u4fe1\u90a3\u4e9b\u5fc3\u5728\u8def\u4e0a\u7684\u4eba\u662f\u6700\u5177\u5305\u5bb9\u5ea6\u7684,\u623f\u9593\u6e96\u5099\u7684\u5404\u54c1\u724c\u6253\u6298\u5361,\u4ea4\u901a\u901b\u8857\u5f88\u65b9\u4fbf\uff64\u623f\u6771\u5bf6\u5bf6\u5f88\u53ef\u611b,\u773c\u85e5\u6c34\u6389\u5728\u4ed6\u5bb6\u88e1\u9084\u63d0\u9192\u6211,\u4e0b\u6b21\u6709\u6a5f\u6703\u5927\u5bb6\u518d\u9078\u64c7\u4ed6\u5011\u5bb6\uff61"}, {"_id": "76574142", "date": {"$date": 1464408000000}, "listing_id": "10458796", "reviewer_id": "70607835", "reviewer_name": "Aileen", "comments": "\u623f\u4e1c\u592b\u59bb\u975e\u5e38\u53cb\u5584\u70ed\u60c5,\u516c\u5bd35\u697c\u7684\u5065\u8eab\u623f\u5f88\u9ad8\u6863,\u53ef\u4ee5\u6e38\u6cf3,\u4e5f\u6709\u8dd1\u6b65\u673a\u53ef\u4ee5\u8dd1\u6b65\uff61\uff61\u9644\u8fd1\u8d2d\u7269\u975e\u5e38\u65b9\u4fbf\uff61\uff61 "}, {"_id": "78431704", "date": {"$date": 1465185600000}, "listing_id": "10458796", "reviewer_id": "8428310", "reviewer_name": "David", "comments": "In the heart of Mongkok - a very busy and densely populated area.

It was more silent than me. \r\n\r\nI didn't make much use of the flat as a whole, but stayed mostly in my room. Have to say, I really liked the husband as did my friend.

They allowed us to leave our luggage before check-in time and after check-out time which was great as we didn't need to carry our bags during the last day before going to the airport. Also, the house looks perfectly the same as it looks in the pictures. The room is small but enough for one-two nights in Hong Kong. The most important thing is that everything was clean and we rest 100% in the room provided. The only thing we are disappointed with is that we couldn't have a chat with them and it could have been a great help for our visit in Hong Kong giving us some tips about the city. That's how Airbnb works, experience in a local house to share a small chat or even a coffee but it wasn't nothing like that.

Everything is done to a really high quality level, from the sheets on the perfectly made bed to the spotless interior and the fantastic breakfast box Cath left for me.  The garden is a wonderful and quiet place to hang out, although it is definitely shared between you and the host.  Privacy feels more private that a room in someone else's house, but probably less than a stand-alone apartment - reasonable since it's a studio in someone's back garden.  The neighborhood is quiet and pretty, with nice cafes and a farmer's market a 15-minute walk.  Getting into and out of other places in the city takes a while; you are not in the center of things, but in a nice neighborhood.  A car or a bike would be more flexible than using transit.

We were blown away with the fresh and tasty eggs Cath provided us from her own chickens on site. Her breakfast hamper has fresh bread, yogurt, muesli, milk and other baked goods that was more than what we needed. Cath is very thoughtful and considerate of her guests and will provide you all the information required to travel, eat and be like a local which is what we wanted to do in our Sydney stay. We also loved her sense of style and the way she has done up the Garden studio. Also there is a lovely vegetable patch with herbs and greens right outside the studio. Very pretty.  The little details matter like the umbrellas, picnic basket, extra blankets, etc that were provided to us. The studio is not located within the CBD area but that was not a problem at all since we were commuting around via trains and buses and did not find any issues doing so. Also it is in a suburb very close to the central area so you are still pretty close. Besides Marickville has some of the best food and coffee options that we explored in our trip. Stay at the Garden studio and you will not be disappointed. We were sad to leave and only wished we could have stayed longer. This has surely been our best AirBnb stay till date. \r\n\r\nP.S. Just make sure you are okay to stay in a loft like bed with a movable ladder to climb up and down which may not suit everyone. That was a highlight for us though and we wanted to experience it :) "}, {"_id": "52111224", "date": {"$date": 1445832000000}, "listing_id": "1047087", "reviewer_id": "23237182", "reviewer_name": "Brittany", "comments": "We had an amazing stay in Cath's studio.

This could make some issues irrelevant for people who intend to stay for a few days to 1 week. \n\nHost:\nGuillermo is a very considerate host and genuinely wants guests to have a great stay. His communications are very quick and he is also very quick in responding to any issues. He is a really nice guy and trustworthy. He personally responds to issues and even got us a microwave oven on request, which was very kind of him. \n\nNoise:\nOne issue we had with the apartment is noise. This is obviously nothing to do with the host but it can't really be ignored in a review. There is a cement factory right behind the apartment and a welders/metal works opposite it. This is going to make noise. Both start work very early in the morning so we often were woke up by the beeping of trucks reversing and the grinding of the metal works across the road. They both work 6 days a week. Probably not an issue for a few days but having that noise every morning for a month is annoying. \n\nArea:\nThe area (Bushwick) is very different to Williamsburg even though some people call it East Williamsburg. Bushwick is more like real life. Good variety of people and cultures and we found it very safe. Plenty of amenities close by. Getting into Manhattan is very simple. L train is 5 stops away from East Village which is great. Bushwick has artists' residence and an amazing Pizza place called Roberta's, which is a must. There is very impressive street art (lots of it) about 5 minutes away. \n\nRooms:\nThe bathroom is new and everything works well. Kitchen is ok but a little limited. We did have some issues with the power going a couple of times in there. It does need re-wiring. The Lounge is nice. TV has Netflix and the Air Con is pretty good and keeps the apartment cool. WiFi is quick. The bed was comfortable. The Furniture is pretty good. Sofa is comfortable and fairly new and it has a good desk and a place to hang clothes. \n\nCleanliness:\nIn addition to the surrounding noise, the only other issue we had was the cleanliness of the apartment. It looks pretty clean when you arrive but the floor left your feet dirty if you walked around barefoot and when you inspected a little closer (behind sofa or fridge) it was pretty dirty. there is a collection of thick dust in-between the bars of the radiators and there was a strange smell by the bed, which we couldn't work out what it was? Bathroom was very clean. It is an old building/apartment and needs a little TLC in terms of the flooring."}, {"_id": "182028746", "date": {"$date": 1502596800000}, "listing_id": "10545815", "reviewer_id": "5042213", "reviewer_name": "Mar\u00eda Soledad", "comments": "We had a great stay at Guillermo's apartment.

The restaurant suggestions came handy when we arrived late at night at the apartment so we headed out to Robertas. Cool place with delicious pizza - unfortunately super busy - even on a Thursday evening - so it seems reservations would be recommended. You can take a cab from the Newark Airport to get there, which is 130$ and takes an hour or you choose the NJ Transit and subway transport which is way cheeper but takes you about 2 hours.

The beds were very comfortable.  The refrigerator was huge.  With a car, we had easy access to the whole coast north and south of Kona.  The snorkeling and other beach gear that came with the house also made our stay easier and more fun!\nThe only con: Two members of our group needed the A/C to sleep.  We found that the A/C in the bedrooms upstairs were kind of loud as it shut off and on through the night.  And the house rule of running it at a 75 degree minimum still seemed warm to us.  But it was still better than nothing, since we didn't want to keep all the bedroom doors open all night to catch the cross breezes (for privacy and to manage the snorers).\nOverall, I would easily recommend this place!

We did wish for AC window units in the downstairs bedrooms like the ones upstairs. But we were there in August, the hottest time of the year.

First of all, the following guests should know that the pretty view on the pictures is not seen from inside the apartment - not of the windows, no out of the terrace either. That was a big letdown for us. You can see the view only from outside of the building and that's quite confusing. Second, you should know that the mouldy smell on the bedding and the big bedroom are unbearable. Me and my husband couldn't sleep there, it was awful. Fortunately we manage to arrange that problem and sleep in the dining room on the couch that become a bed. The main problem in Regina's apartment is the mouldy smell that she explained is due to the location of the apartment. In spite of all that, Regina was very helpful host. She let us leave our luggage at their family hotel on chek-out day because we had 4 hours to spare before going to the airport. We had a great time mainly on the terrace which is right next to the kitchen. The neighborhood was great - quiet, there is a big market and bus stops very close by. Very easy to get to the city center and even the night buses stopped very close. Bunkers de can Baro are very close to the apartment - 1o min. walk up on the hill. They were spectacular.
