### Step 5 - Git Push - share your commits with remote repository

When you make a modification on the local repository, you can **share** you work with `git push` command following these steps:

- **add** files modified to staging area with command `git add <file name>`
- **commit** changes with `git commit -m "<comment on commit>"`
- **push** changes to remote branch with command `git push <remote name> <destination branch>` where
	- *remote name* is the friendly name of the remote repository
	- *destination branch* is the name of the branch to push to

If *destination branch* does not exist in the remote repository, it will be created.

To be able to push, **write access** are needed on the remote.

If another user pushed in the meantime, your push will be rejected and you will need to **merge** with new changes **before pushing** again

A typical Git workflow would be to perform **multiple small commits** as you work on a task and **push** to a remote **at relevant points**, such as when the task is completed.

#### Task

- Go to `~/repo/local_working_dir`
- Create and checkout a new branch *new_branch*
- Create a new file *new_feature.py*
- Add the file to staging area with `git add`
- Commit the change with `git commit -m`
- Push the commit to the new remote branch *new_branch*
- Switch to master branch
- Run `ls` to list available files, you will see that *new_feature.py* is not there
- Merge *master* with *new_branch*
- Run `ls` to list available files, you will now see *new_feature.py*
- Push *master* to remote repository
