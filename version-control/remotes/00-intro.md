# Working with Remotes

Collaborating with others on any project requires a way to share work among colleagues.
In Git this is done through remote repositories. These are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere.

Users generally have permissions to:
- **read** work made by others fetching and pulling from remotes
- **write** changes to project pushing and merging to remotes

Sharing work involves:
- **managing** remote repositories locations
- **send** and **receive** updates and changes on work
- **analyze** and **solve** conflicts when working on common project parts

In this scenario we will first configure the environment with a local remote.
Then we will simulate simple operations that can happen when working on a remote repository with other people.
