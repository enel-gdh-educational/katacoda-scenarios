In this scenario you will learn how to use the major functionalities of bitbucket in the Springlab environment.

##### What is BitBucket

**Git != Bitbucket or GitHub**

Git = a distributed version control tool that can manage a development project's source code history. Git focuses exclusively on tasks related to source code management, without any departure into peripheral topics, such as security, authentication, software quality or CI.

BitBucket = is a **cloud based platform** built around the Git tool exposing some useful features like:

* Easy Collaboration: share your repository with other (git itself can with the `git-daemon` command, but it's not very handy)
* Project Management: issue and task tracker
* Security: repository and branch permission
* Devops: enable CI/CD process


##### Distributed Version Control System

When you are using BitBucket your are still working with a Distributed Version Control System!
