# Process management: introduction

Let's start with defining what a process is. <br>
Practically speaking, a **process** in Linux system is a program (or part of a program) in execution on the machine;
 we say also "part of" because a program might be composed of more than one single process (and it often is). The Linux operative system itself runs a lot of processes in background.
<br>
The ``ps`` command (ps stands for **P**rocess **S**tate) is one of the most popular Linux command to display the status of the processes that the system is executing, at the time you input the command.

 --- 
In this section you'll familiarize with processes: launching, monitoring and also stopping them.<br>
But there's more: we'll show you some extra Linux functionalities, for instance to concatenate shell command, or to search for specific words.
You'll see how this additions help in the context of process management.

We'll provide you the basic tools to be aware at anytime of what is running on your machine and the power to decide what to do with it. <br>
Just remember that **with great power comes great responsibility**.
